    "The goal of this assignment is to get accustomed with `torch.tensor`, the `timeit` function, and `matplotlib` by expanding upon what we did in class. This assignment will go over matrix-matrix multiplication and measure the speedup of vectorized multiplication vs. plain python multiplication."

    "First up, I wrote a function that generates a matrix as a list of lists and populates it with random numbers. This function essentially generates the data we will use to do matrix-matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the matrix easier to comprehend, the function will, by default, populate the matrix with values ranging from 0 to 100 rounded to two decimal places. "
